# Nerve of Steel Timer

### MGTC28 In-class Assignmetn 4 by Louis Doukas

timer.py is a simple Python script setting a timer between 5-25 seconds starting from the beginning of the game when the program informs players to stand.  
Upon timer expiry, the program will display text indicating to players that the game is over. 
timer.py uses the **time library** to help keep track of time and the **random library** to set a random time duration.


Please see the documentation for the library used:
- [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)
- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
